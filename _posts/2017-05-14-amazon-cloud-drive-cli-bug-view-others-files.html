<p>I just wanted to make you aware of a small bug that allows one to view other Amazon Cloud Drive (ACD) even though it is not authenticated.</p>
<blockquote><p>First your DB somehow gets corrupted. Delete it, acdcli sync, then tada.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please be wary of using ACD_CLI utility until it is patched. And it is definitely recommend to use encryption!<br />
