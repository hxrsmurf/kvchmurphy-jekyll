<p>The Nintendo Switch will begin shipping Friday, March 3, 2017 in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan. The initial cost will be $299.99 which includes 32GB of internal storage, a 720p 6.2 inch LCD touchscreen, dock, controller with grips &amp; straps, an HDMI cable, and power adapter. Remember, like the 3DS, the Switch is going back to cartridges which are able to store game files on its internal storage.</p>
