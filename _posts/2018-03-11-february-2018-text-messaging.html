<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are already in the month of March! I sent 1933 texts and received 1517. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I trended down in the afternoon in sending and receiving. I then trended up as I woke up and got around for work. My weekends are consistently low, most likely because everyone is sleeping when I am awake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend “Tyler 1” was number one this month! Taking Colin &amp; Brandon from their long lasting thrones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just thought of the idea to see who was out of the top 10. I did a filter to exclude anyone that has more than the last top 10 overall, which in this case is 93 texts (received and sent). The results were quite interesting! </span></p>
