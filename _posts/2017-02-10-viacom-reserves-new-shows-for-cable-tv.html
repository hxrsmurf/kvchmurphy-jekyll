<p>Viacom CEO, Robert Bakish, wants to remove new programming from streaming services like Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix, so only TV cable providers receive the new programming. However, Viacom will still release older content to the streaming services. By sticking with the cable companies, Viacom's bottom line will increase; the cable companies pay more than the streaming services.</p>
<p>According to Engadget, Bakish's words of reassurance during the earnings call will keep the cable companies happy because the new TV shows will hook paying customers.</p>
