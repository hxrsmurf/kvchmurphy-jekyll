<p>An old friend was preparing for his first interview out of college. I wrote a few paragraphs from my experiences and turned them into a bullet point list.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind your mileage may vary &amp; each interview/company is different.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here are my top 3 interview tips, questions I was asked, and questions I asked from several of my interviews in my young career. Scroll down for an expanded list of each category.</p>
<h3>Tips:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Be confident in yourself and your abilities.</li>
<li>The interview is a two-way street.</li>
<li>Have a good time and learn from each interview.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Interviewer Questions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>What 3 character traits would a co-worker list for you?</li>
<li>Explain $technology in a non-technical and technical way.</li>
<li>What sets you apart from other candidates?</li>
</ol>
<h3>My Questions:</h3>

<h1>General Interview Tips:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Rest your hands on your pants, so when you get up to shake the interviewer(s) hand.</li>
<li>Be confident in yourself and your abilities, the company chose you to interview.</li>
<li>Ask meaningful, sincere questions - questions that would not be answered on the company's "About Us" page.</li>
<li>Have a personable, sociable conversation - it is a human interaction, not an interrogation.</li>
<li>Actively listen and ask follow up questions.</li>
<li>Allow extra time to get to the location, show up early - be the one that waits on them.</li>
<li>Do not memorize your answers, it sounds robotic when you answer.</li>
<li>The interview is two-way street: you are interviewing them too.</li>
<li>Have a good time, if you do not get the job, learn from it!</li>
