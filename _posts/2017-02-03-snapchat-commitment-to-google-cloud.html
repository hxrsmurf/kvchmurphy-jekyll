<p>Snapchat's recently filed for an initial public offering (IPO). In its filing, Snapchat says it is estimating $2 billion to be spent in the next five (5) years in Google Compute. Snapchat has invested heavily into this cloud provider. If Google Cloud suffers disruptions or Snapchat market (users, businesses, partners, etc.) cannot access the application, Snapchat suspects it will negatively impact their core operations like user growth, revenue, and partner relationships. Snapchat is one of the first to announce an all-in approach with Google Compute.</p>
