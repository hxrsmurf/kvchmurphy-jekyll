<p>I am in the mood for more stats. I found that Google Sheets is a little better with fewer pivot tables. The data I created can be easily made in Google Sheets, but unfortunately, multiple pivot tables cannot be on the same sheet in Google Sheets. Therefore, I wanted to use <em>countifs</em> formula.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Tigers won 64 of their games and lost 98 of them.</li>
<li>They mostly won and lost at away night games.</li>
<li>While playing against Cleveland, they only won 2-day games and 4-night games.</li>
<li>These statistics can be dangerous because there were much more overall night games than day games 105 and 57 respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-gj_IKV_mOfe0mcZNYdlHtq7fedIiSYZtjiKdBsBmeM/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a>!</p>
