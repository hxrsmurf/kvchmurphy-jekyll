<p>Fiat-Chrysler Automobile (FCA) recently announced they are recalling nearly five million vehicles in the U.S. This recall has no confirmed cases, but there is a possibility of not being able to turn off the cruise control. FCA suggests this can be fixed with a software update at the dealership. FCA states this can occur when an electrical short-circuit happens at the same time as cruise control is accelerating. While the stopping cruise control and hitting the brakes should overpower the engine and stop the vehicle, this might not work. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says "drivers should shift into neutral, forcefully apply the brake and put the vehicle in park once it's stopped."</p>
<p>Here is a list of the affected models:</p>
<ul>
<li>2014 - 2019 RAM 1500</li>
<li>2014 - 2018 RAM 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500</li>
<li>2015 - 2017 Chrsler 200</li>
<li>2014 - 2018 Chrysler 300</li>
<li>2017 and 2018 Chrysler Pacifica</li>
<li>2015 - 2018 Dodge Challenger</li>
<li>2014 - 2018 Dodge Charger, Journey and Durango</li>
<li>2014 - 2018 Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee</li>
<li>2018 Wrangler</li>
</ul>
