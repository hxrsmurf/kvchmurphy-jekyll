<p>Here's the Google <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/open/11dudPWndPHApMfCZW9mdEQn3nP9cprE-">Data Studio</a> for this month. I almost published before double-checking for my friend "Brandon 1." Signal has the country code and omits the dash between the phone number. My "contact" SQL table, well BigQuery table, has those dashes. I guess I could update/add the contact, but eh lazy.</p>
<p>I've been able to optimize my workflow with the tools below. Here's the <a href="https://kvchmurphy.com/2018/07/how-to-export-encrypted-signal-messages/">tutorial</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>xml2json</li>
<li>jq</li>
<li>TimeZone convert</li>
<li>Better Excel formulas</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm back at it with texting every single hour of a day during the month! Yay. Eventually, I'll sit down and look at these stats in a larger picture...but not today.</p>
<p>I'm down to about 30-45 minutes or so. The hardest part is parsing the WhatsApp text file. It just does one-by-one line for each message and doesn't split it up at all. So, I do a bunch of left, right, find, and trims to get that. The timezone convert formula in Excel definitely helps with Signal, as well as the xml2json.</p>
<p>I think a few months ago, I converted to a better Google BigQuery formula. I am able to copy the report template each time and just update the record source with the new query. The "new query" is not really new, I simply update the "month = [month here]".</p>
<p>If you're new to the stats, I just like looking at the graphs and numbers. It obviously looks like a ranking system, but I don't mean it to be!</p>
