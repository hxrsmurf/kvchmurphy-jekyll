<p>I recently had a ticket come in for another customer that had a load balanced setup between three hosts: host1, host2, and host3. Each host uses a server-side script to send e-mail via an external mail server.</p>
<p>While troubleshooting, we noticed host1 and host3 were working just fine with the e-mail script. Host2 was having difficulties. We checked the firewall on all three servers; they were all the same. There were no custom entries in the Windows hosts file.</p>
<p>I finally had the bright idea to run <em>route print</em> in command prompt and voila! There was an extra default gateway for host2. After deleting that extra gateway, all three hosts were functioning as normal.</p>
<p>Although it was not DNS this time, routing is definitely important in network traffic (obviously).</p>
