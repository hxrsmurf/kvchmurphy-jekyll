<p>Tesla will be rolling out its next autopilot system dubbed "Enhance Autopilot." Since October 2016, Tesla has been upgrading their vehicles with newer hardware.</p>
<p>Some of this newer hardware and their features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eight cameras
<ul>
<li>Provide 360-degree visibility and 820 feet of range</li>
<li>Find optimal routes toÂ destinations</li>
<li>Navigate rural and urban areas without lane markings</li>
<li>Manage intersections with stop signs, traffic lights, and roundabouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhanced radar sensor - visibility "through heavy rain, fog, dust, and even a car in front of it."</li>
<li>12 ultrasonic sensors - detect hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance as previous sensors</li>
<li>Nvidia's Drive PX2 - 40 times the computing power as previous systems</li>
</ul>
<p>This new Autopilot system is available for $5,000 when buying a new Tesla.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some features of this Enhanced Autopilot are:<br />
Match speed to traffic conditions</li>
<li>Automatically change lanes without driver input</li>
<li>Merge on and off highways</li>
<li>Park itself</li>
<li>Better maneuverability when summoning</li>
</ul>
<p>These great new features will be released in multiple phases.</p>
<p>Details of the first phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolled out in January 2017</li>
<li>Active Cruise Control</li>
<li>Forward Collision Warning</li>
<li>Autosteer capped at a speed 45 miles per hour</li>
<li>Included an Easter Egg that allows the Model S P100D in Ludicrous mode, to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 2.4 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of the second phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Released in March 2017</li>
<li>Increasing the Autosteer speed to 55 miles per hour</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of the third phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Released in June 2017</li>
<li>Allow autonomous perpendicular parking</li>
<li>Remove Autosteer speed cap</li>
</ul>
<p>End of 2017 Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely autonomous vehicular experience with second-generation Autopilot hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>This entire self-driving system will cost $8,000 at the time of purchase. This self-driving system will include all of these new features that Enhanced Autopilot brings to Tesla's vehicles.<br />
"The foundation has been laid for fully autonomous. It's twice as safe as a human, maybe better," Musk said in October on a call with journalists introducing the new Autopilot system. "It's basically a supercomputer in the car."</p>
