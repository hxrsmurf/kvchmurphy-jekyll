<p>A lot delayed on March and April text messages. I've been meaning to do a yearly review, but it always seems to tedious. So, here come two quick ones.</p>
<p>The run down:</p>
<ol>
<li>Received 1,003</li>
<li>Sent 1,186</li>
<li>The FIRST month in a while that I had very low numbers for a long period of time</li>
<li>Mondays were the top day</li>
<li>Tyler 1 was the top person</li>
</ol>
