<p>Google may bring its Android One initiative to the US. Android One is Google’s cellphone product upcoming markets like India. The initial project had $100 and $200 devices. A report (paywalled) suggests if Google brings Android One to the US they may partner with LG for a product between $200 to $300.</p>
<p>As Arstechnica writes, a more important question is, “who will handle OS updates?” Google said they would at first, but “After a rough reception in India...” Google has suggested the hardware partners, not Google will provide updates.</p>
<p>With my Android experience, the closer Google themselves updates, the better the entire Android experience. Let’s hope Google takes the reigns on Android One in the US.</p>
