<p>I am a little bit delayed on the December text messaging stats. I just really didn't want to sit down and look at them. I'm not very "artisty" so I struggle with graph colors. I did recently read an article that suggested to keep the color scheme simple. This allows for the graph to display the data without any extra input. This is why I have grayscaled the ones that I can. I found that the black and grey was difficult to read.</p>
<p>Anyhow, onto the stats! 2216 texts sent and 1604 texts received in December.</p>
<p>My active hours are still all over the place! I am still trying to figure out a good sleep schedule for the third-shift work schedule, Tuesday evening to Sunday morning. On a personal note, I have been finding success with going to sleep around noon and waking up at 2100.</p>
<p>I am guessing that 11AM is peak activity because I'm awake and my friends are awake. It is interesting to see Tuesday has only 4 texts at 11AM. I speculate that this is because I have been switching to a first shift for the weekend and drastically changing for Tuesday. Basically, catching up on sleep Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>There is not a whole lot to say about the activity during the week, business as usual! Although, Steven and Colin had the same activity on Thursdays; too spooky for me.</p>
<p>We can see that Colin remains on his throne since last month at number 1! He and I like to see how late he stays up during the week. As we can see, he drops off at the end of 2AM.</p>
