<p>A few months ago, Verizon announced its plan to acquire Yahoo for $4.83 billion. Now, Verizon is shedding $350 million off of this new deal.</p>
<p>Part of this new deal, Verizon and Yahoo will share "share the legal and regulatory burdens that will come from the hacks the website suffered in 2013 and 2014." Also, Yahoo will foot-the-bill for "any non-SEC government investigations and lawsuits related to the hack."</p>
