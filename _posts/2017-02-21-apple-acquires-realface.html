<p>Apple has recently acquired RealFace, an Israeli facial recognizion program. There is no price of the purchase, but "RealFace had raised around $1 million prior to the acquisition."</p>
<p>RealFace developed Pickeez, an iPhone app, that assists the user to choose his/her best photo in their social media profiles.</p>
