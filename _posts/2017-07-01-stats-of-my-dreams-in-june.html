<p>I might do a "six-month review" on the dreams. To see if there has been a change of day or not during the months. I have a feeling in June, Friday is not the "norm." I could obviously look back at the other stats, but I think I would rather do a separate article with more data.</p>
<p>In June, the average character length of the dreams was about 87 characters. Therefore, I set the "detailed dream" threshold to that. If any dream was longer than the aforementioned character length, it would be determined a "detailed dream."</p>
<p>Here are the stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>52 total dreams in June, 40% of them were detailed</li>
<li>75% of my dreams on Saturday were detailed, runner-ups were Thursday and Saturday</li>
<li>10 dreams were around 0500 and 50% of them were detailed, runner-up was 1000</li>
<li>12 dreams were on Friday, 33% of them were detailed</li>
<li>0500 to 1100 I had dreams, at 0700 100% of them were detailed</li>
</ul>
