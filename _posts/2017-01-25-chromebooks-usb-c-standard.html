<p>As reported by AndroidCentral, Google "will have standard super-fast USB-C charging, so one Chromebook cart can charge any device quickly."</p>
<p>ChromeBooks will also become more usable with stylus capability and world-facing camera as well as Android Apps and a suite of Adobe Android apps optimized for ChromeBooks.</p>
