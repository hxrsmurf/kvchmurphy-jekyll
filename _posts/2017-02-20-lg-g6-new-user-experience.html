<p>The new LG G6 will feature a 18:9 display. LG suggests this ratio will improve "search and multimedia viewing."</p>
<p>In addition to the new ratio, LG wil be adding a "square GUI and multitasking feature" for its camera user experience.</p>
<p>The user's movies, apps and games will be optimized for this new 18:9 ratio. If desired, some content can alter to the 16:9 ratio.</p>
<p>The new camera experience dubbed "Square Camera" will allow the screen to split into two which allows photos to be taken and viewed at the same time. Also, this split screen will allow easy-to-upload to social media.</p>
<p>There were also be a new "food mode" which allows between two and 100 photos to be strung together to make GIF videos.</p>
