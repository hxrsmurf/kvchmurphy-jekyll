<p>Google announced in a recent blog post that Gmail users can now receive up to 50 megabyte attachments. The sending of 25 megabyte attachment limit is still in effect, because Google is pushing users to use Google Drive to send bigger attachments. One can link a file from Google Drive into their outgoing e-mail very easily.</p>
