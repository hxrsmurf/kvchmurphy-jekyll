<p>Microsoft is suspected to cut 700 jobs next week, 22 Jan 2017. Microsoft's current employee head count is about 113,000. An insider says these layoffs are not cost saving, but to improve various departments. Even with this round of layoffs, and a few before, Microsoft has about 1600 openings on LinkedIn.</p>
