<p>A bit delayed in the new year. Check out the <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/open/107e2SeNcwWtprCi0mWQs3Quug6Gk7wf6">Google Data Studio</a> for detailed graphs.</p>
<p>Once again I texted at every single hour in the month of January! I usually sent on Monday mornings. Brandon 1 is back at number 1...for now. We spoke the most around 7AM and Mondays (two separate metrics).</p>
<p>The final panel has a filter for each individual.</p>
