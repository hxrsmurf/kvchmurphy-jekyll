<p>Interestingly, Rob is back on top at #1. My friend Brandon and I switched to Signal for messaging because both of our LG G6's on Verizon network are acting terribly with the latest Android update. Sometimes messages send, sometimes they do not. I did find a way to backup Signal and decrypt the messages. We'll have to investigate that at a later time.</p>
