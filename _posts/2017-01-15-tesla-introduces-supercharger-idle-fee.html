<p>With the upcoming numbers of Tesla vehicles around the world, drivers are taking advantage of Supercharging stations for not only charging, but also as their own dedicated parking spot. Elon Musk says "Supercharger spots are meant for charging, not parking."</p>
<p>Tesla recently introduced a small idle fee for a car that remains on the Supercharger. The Tesla App will track this and charge the driver $0.40 fee per minute. The small fee will be waived if the car is moved within 5 minutes of full charge. Also, this will only occur if the Supercharging station is 50% full.</p>
