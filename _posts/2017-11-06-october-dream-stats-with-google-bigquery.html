<p>Edit: 11 December 2017 - While compiling November stats, I unfortunately noticed that I converted the date to the wrong weekday. Future stats will be fixed. This one I am not going to. Each weekday is one more than it should be. So, if it says Tuesday, it's actually Monday.</p>
<p>Like my text stats, I decided to import the dream data into Google BigQuery even though there are only 170 rows. I would recommend that you click the link below to look at the pretty graphs. I am a little too lazy to embed them here.</p>

<ul>
<li>October - 63 dreams</li>
<li>Wednesday - 13 dreams
<ul>
<li>0400 &amp; 1100 - 2 dreams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>0700 - 13 dreams
<ul>
<li>TuesdayÂ - 4 dreams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, I had no dreams on Sunday's at 0700!</p>
<p>September vs. October</p>
<ul>
