<p>The Document Foundation has just released LibreOffice 5.3, an open source alternative to Microsoft Office and Google Suite. Part of the 5.3 release, LibreOffice introduced a server service, so one can have LibreOffice in "the cloud." This online solution is based on a LibreOffice developer company called Collabora.</p>
