<p>According to a recent quarterly report, Disney will be creating its own video-streaming service in 2019. This may coincide with the expiration of Netflix-Disney deal that was recently expanded last year.</p>
<p>ESPN, a subsidiary of Disney, will be launching a sports-streaming service in 2018 which should be able to stream NHL, MLB, and MLS to users.</p>
