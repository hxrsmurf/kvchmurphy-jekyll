<p>I consider my dreams as "detailed" if I write more than 50 characters about them. I got this number by looking at what I have written and determining if it had good detail or a lot happened, versus bad recording due to waking up from sleep.</p>
<p>I also work second shift, 1600 to 0000. I usually actively fall asleep between 0300 to 0400.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here are some conclusions about my dreams in April.</p>
<ul>
<li>I recorded a total of 54 dreams</li>
<li>57.41% of my dreams in April were detailed - if my description of the dream is more than 50 characters</li>
<li>On Thursdays and Fridays, I have the most dreams (13 and 12, respectively)</li>
<li>On Fridays and Sundays, I have the most detailed to non-detailed  dream ratio (75%)</li>
<li>On Fridays and Thursdays, I have the most detailed dreams (9 and 8, respectively)</li>
<li>Around 0000, 0400, and 1500, I have the most detailed dreams (100%!)</li>
<li>Around 0900, I record the most dreams (11)</li>
</ul>
