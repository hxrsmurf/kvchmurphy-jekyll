<p>Description:<br />
During the first time setup process, the console stays on a preparing screen when you attempt to link or create a Nintendo Account.</p>
<p>Complete These Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempt to power off the console.</li>
<li>If the console will not power off, hold the Power Button for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>Power the console back on, and continue with the setup process, except skip the process of linking a Nintendo Account.</li>
<li>Once the setup has been complete, update the console to the latest system menu version.</li>
<li>After the system is updated, return to the user settings and link your Nintendo Account.</li>
</ol>
<p>I recently picked up a Nintendo Switch for Zelda: Breath of the Wild. When setting it up and linking my Nintendo Account, the screen was stuck on "Preparing Device" or something "Preparing." I waited ten (10) minutes and found this article.</p>
